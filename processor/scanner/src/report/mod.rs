          The new session will only be responsible for signing this Batch if the prior key has
          retired, successfully completed all its on-external-network actions.

          We check here the prior session has successfully completed all its on-Serai-network
          actions by ensuring we've validated all Batches expected from it. Only then do we sign
          the Batch confirming the handover.

          We also wait for the Batch confirming the handover to be accepted on-chain, ensuring we
          don't verify the prior session's Batches, sign the handover Batch and the following
          Batch, have the prior session publish a malicious Batch where our handover Batch should
          be, before our following Batch becomes our handover Batch.
