    constants target the Cancun network upgrade and are validated by the tests.

    While whoever publishes these transactions may be able to query a gas estimate, it may not be
    reasonable to. If the signing context is a distributed group, as Serai frequently employs, a
    non-deterministic gas (such as estimates from the local nodes) would require a consensus
    protocol to determine  which to use.

    These gas limits may break if/when gas opcodes undergo repricing. In that case, this library is
    expected to be modified with these made parameters. The caller would then be expected to pass
    the correct set of prices for the network they're operating on.
