  The Router directly performs low-level calls in order to fine-tune the gas settings. Since this
  contract is meant to relay an entire batch of transactions, the ability to exactly meter
  individual transactions is critical.

  We don't check the return values as we don't care if the calls succeeded. We solely care we made
  them. If someone configures an external contract in a way which borks, we epxlicitly define that
  as their fault and out-of-scope to this contract.

  If an actual invariant within Serai exists, an escape hatch exists to move to a new contract. Any
  improperly handled actions can be re-signed and re-executed at that point in time.
