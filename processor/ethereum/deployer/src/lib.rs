        This needs to use a fixed gas price to achieve a deterministic address. The gas price is
        fixed to 100 gwei, which should be generous, in order to make this unlikely to get stuck.
        While potentially expensive, this only has to occur per chain this is deployed on.

        If this is too low of a gas price, private mempools can be used, with other transactions in
        the bundle raising the gas price to acceptable levels. While this strategy could be
        entirely relied upon, allowing the gas price paid to reflect the network's actual gas
        price, that wouldn't work for EVM networks without private mempools.

        That leaves this as failing only if it violates a protocol constant, or if the gas price is
        too low on a network without private mempools to publish via. In that case, this code
        should to be forked to accept an enum of which network the deployment is for (with the gas
        price derivative of that, as common as possible across networks to minimize the amount of
        addresses representing the Deployer).
